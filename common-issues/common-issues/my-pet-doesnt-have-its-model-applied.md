# My pet doesn't have its model applied

You are most likely using a free demo version of ModelEngine.

The free demo version which only allows a limited amount of models :

* **If you want to keep using the demo version :** remove some models that are working on your server in "./plugins/ModelEngine/blueprints" until you have less than 6 models in that folder.
* **Recommended solution :** buy the premium version of Model Engine.
