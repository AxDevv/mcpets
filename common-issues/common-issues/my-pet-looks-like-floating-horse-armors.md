You have to apply the Model Engine resource pack to your client.

Fetch the resource pack into "./plugins/ModelEngine/", there is a "resource pack.zip". Take that file, put it into your "resource pack" folder in Minecraft (Escape menu, video settings, resource pack, then open resource pack folder).
