# Category : I can't see my pets

First make sure your category is setup correctly by having a look at the [category template](../../tutorials/plugin-features/categories.md#how-to).

If you still can't see the pets you've added to the category or that you can't see the category at all, but it says it's loading correctly in the console when you _"/mcpets reload",_ then make sure the pet IDs you have set matches with pets that are registered into MCPets.

To make sure they are, open the pet config file of the pet you are willing to add, and make sure you have correctly put the "_Id_" into the category file.&#x20;
