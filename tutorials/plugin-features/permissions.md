# Permissions

## List of available permissions

Here are all the permissions provided by MCPets and what it allows :

* _mcpets.use_ : enable GUI opening, pet interactions
* _mcpets.admin_ : access others' pet interaction menu, spawning pet to others and all other commands
* _mcpets.colors_ : enable colors in pet's name
* _your.custom.pet.permission_ : each pet has its own access permission, so you can unlock them to players through quests, events, etc... You can find and change that permission into the pet config.
