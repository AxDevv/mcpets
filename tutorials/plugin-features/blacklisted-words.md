# Blacklisted Words

## Use the blacklist to forbid words in pets' name

This file is auto-generated by MCPets as "_blacklist.yml_".

Its basic syntax is given in the YAML code down below.

Case and colors are filtered during word check, so don't bother with these kinds of expressions :

* Case isn't important : `MyWord` is equivalent to `myword`
* Color filter : `&6My&cWord` is equivalent to `myword`

```yaml
Blacklist:
- your_first_word_to_blacklist
- your_second_word_to_blacklist
```
